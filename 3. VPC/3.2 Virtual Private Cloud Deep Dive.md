#### A. DHCP in a VPC
(+) Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for auto configuration of network resources.
(+) Starts with L2 broadcast to get info from DHCP server.
(+) `DHCP Option Sets`: cannot be edited - once created, they're immutable, it can be associated with 0 or more VPCs

#### B. VPC Router Deep Dive
(+) Virtual Router within a VPC
(+) `Highly Available` - across all AZs in that region
(+) `No management overhead`, as it is automatically configure by AWS
(+) `Scalable` - no performance management required
(+) `Routes` `traffic` `between` `subnet`.
(+) Controlled using route tables
==> Interface in every subnet in `subnet + 1` address.

![[Pasted image 20240819165637.png]]

(+) Every VPC is created with a `main route table (MRT)`, and it is default for every subnet in the VPC
(+) Custom route tables can be created and associated with subnets in the VPC - removing the association with the `MRT`.

#### C. Internet Gateway (IGW) Deep Dive
(+) `1 to 1` relationship, `1 IGW` per `VPC`, `1 VPC` per `IGW`
(+) Architecturally at the VPC & AWS Public Zone border.
(+) It is used to access `AWS Public Services` and `Public Internet`.
(+) `Highly available` by default and `scales` by default

###### C1. Egress-Only Internet Gateway
(+) With IPv4 addresses are private or public
(+) `NAT` allows `private IPs` to access `public networks`, without allowing externally initiated connections
(+) With IPv5 all IPs are Public, therefore, Internet Gateway allows all IPs `In` and `Out`
===> We need a service to connect the IPv6 `Out` (and response `IN`), but not `externally initiated IN connection`.

#### D. NAT Deep Dive

###### D1. NAT Instance
(+) NAT Software running on an EC2 Instance, it is end of life and recommended to move to NATGW.
(+) The speed is based on `size` and `type` of EC2 instance.

#### E. AWS PrivateLink
(+) AWS PrivateLink allows application in a private subnet of VPC to connect to a service which is not in current VPC without leaving the AWS network.
==> Â VPC peering allows us to do same but it establishes a connection with a scope which is too big. Also peering does have a restriction of non-overlapping CIDR
==> `AWS PrivateLink` allows access to the `service` not the `VPC`.

###### E1. AWS PrivateLink and AWS VPC Endpoint (Gateway)
###### **AWS PrivateLink**:
(+) **Overview**: AWS PrivateLink is a service that allows you to access AWS services (like Amazon S3, DynamoDB) or your own services hosted on AWS privately, over a private network connection.
(+) **How It Works**: It uses VPC Endpoint Interface to provide private connectivity between VPCs or between VPCs and on-premises networks without exposing traffic to the public internet.
(+) **Use Case**: Ideal for accessing services across different VPCs or from on-premises to VPC securely.

###### **VPC Endpoint Gateway**:
(+) **Overview**: A VPC Endpoint Gateway is a specific type of VPC endpoint that allows you to connect to certain AWS services, specifically Amazon S3 and DynamoDB, from your VPC using a private network connection.
(+) **How It Works**: When you create a VPC Endpoint Gateway, it adds an entry to your route table, directing traffic destined for the service (like S3 or DynamoDB) through the gateway.
(+) **Use Case**: Useful when you want to access S3 or DynamoDB without using the internet gateway, ensuring that all traffic remains within the AWS network.

###### **VPC Endpoint Interface**:
(+) **Overview**: A VPC Endpoint Interface is a type of VPC endpoint that allows you to connect to many AWS services privately, over private IP addresses within your VPC. It is used in conjunction with AWS PrivateLink.
(+) **How It Works**: When you create a VPC Endpoint Interface, it creates an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) within your subnet, and traffic to the AWS service flows through this ENI.
(+)**Use Case**: Ideal for accessing services like EC2 APIs, SNS, CloudWatch, and many others from within your VPC securely and privately.

#### C. VPC Flow Logs
(+) Capture `metadata` (not contents), it is attached to a `VPC` and it will capture `ALL ENIs` in that `VPC`.
(+) If it is attached to a `Subnet`, it will capture `ALL ENIs` in that `Subnet`
(+) Flow logs are `NOT` real time.
(+) Log destinations can be `S3` or `CloudWatch` Logs, and we can use `Athena for querying` using SQL.

![[Pasted image 20240819171529.png]]

###### C1. VPC Flow Logs format
![[Pasted image 20240819171923.png]]

(+) The first log is accepted as the security group and NACL allows the inbound, the second log is rejected maybe because it is not allowed in the NACL, despite the SG is two-ways.

#### D. VPC Traffic Mirroring
(+) Copy network traffic from an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) from your EC2 instance into your VPCs and send it to the security and monitoring appliances. This is done for `Content inspection`, `Threat Monitoring`, `Troubleshooting`
(+) `Source`: A network interface with the type `instance`, `Target`: the destination for mirrored traffic.
(+) `Filter`: A set of rules that defines the traffic that is copied in a traffic mirror session
(+) `Session`: An entity that describes Trafic Monitoring from a source to a target using filter

#### E. IPSEC VPN Fundamentals
(+) IPSEC is a group of protocols, it sets up `secure tunnels` across `insecure networks` between two peers (`local` and `remote`).
(+) It provides authentication and encryption.\
![[Pasted image 20240821102406.png]]

(+) IPSEC has `two` main phases:

(+) Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Phase 1 which is `slow and heavy`. It will authenticate - pre-shared key (password)/Certificate for the process. This will use Asymmetric encryption to agree on, and create a shared Symmetric key. By the end of this, we will have an IKE SA (Security Association) Created (phase 1 tunnel).

![[Pasted image 20240821103406.png]]

(+) IKE Phase 2 which is fast and agile, this will agree on encryption method, and keys used for bulk data transfer. By the end of this, we will have an IPSEC SA, which is a phase 2 tunnel (architecturally running over phase 1)

![[Pasted image 20240821103619.png]]

(+) VPN can be divided into `Policy-based VPNs` and `Route-based VPNs`. `Policy-based VPNs` has rule sets match traffic => a pair of SAs with different rules/security settings. `Route-based VPNs` is target matching (prefix) that matches a single pair of SAs.

![[Pasted image 20240821104101.png]]

#### F. Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) Deep Dive
(+) `Gateway` object between `AWS VPCs` and `non AWS Networks` for on-premise and other clouds.
(+) It is attached to `max one` VPC at a time, it can be detached and reattached.
(+) it maintains its connections using DX (Private VIF), DX Gateway and Site-2-Site VPN (public IPs)
(+) Private ASN - defaults to 64512
(+) It is HA by default - multiple AZs (VPNs multiple endpoint)

![[Pasted image 20240821104658.png]]

#### G. AWS Site-to-Site VPN
(+) A logical connection between a VPC and on-premises network encrypted using IPSec, running over the `public internet`.
(+) Full HA - if you design and implement it correctly.
(+) Quick to provision less than an hour.
(+) We have the following options: `Vitual Private Gateway (VGW)`, `Customer Gateway (CGW)`, VPN Connection between the `VGW` and `CGW`.

![[Pasted image 20240821105629.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240821105802.png]]

(+) Static and Dynamic VPN, Dynamic VPN use BGP, so if the customer router does not support this we can't use it. The only different between static and dynamic VPN is how they route traffic.

![[Pasted image 20240821110150.png]]
(+) VPN has some consideration, speed limitation (1.25 Gbps)
(+) Latency consideration - inconsistent, public internet
(+) Cost - AWS hourly cost, GB out cost, data cap (on premises)
(+) Speed of setup - hours as they are all software configuration.
(+) Can be used as a backup for Direct Connect (DX)
(+) Can be used with Direct Connect (DX)

#### H. VPC DNS and DNS Endpoint
(+) `DNS` via the VPC .2 address 10.16.0.2 (A4L)
(+) `.2` is reserved in every subnet
(+) It is now called the `Route53` Resolver, it provides R53 Public and Associated Private Zones
(+) Only accessible from `within a VPC`
(+) Hybrid network integration is `problematic` - `IN` an `OUT`.

![[Pasted image 20240821152026.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240821152540.png]]
(+) `Route53 Endpoints` are VPC interfaces (`ENIs`) - Accessible over VPN or DX
(+) `Inbound` for forwarding from `On-premises` to the `R53` `Resolver` and `Outbound` as conditional forwarders, from `R53` to `On-premises`.
(+) Rules control what requests are forwarded.
(+) corp.animals4life.org => On-premises DNS Nameserver. We can also whitelist on-premise IP as they are unique IP.

![[Pasted image 20240821153516.png]]

#### I. EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV)
(+) Networking is traditionally virtualized
(+) VM's (instances) share a physical network interface (NIC), and the hypervisor mediates access (which makes it slow).
(+) There is a way, direct access between 1 VM and 1 NIC, but this will tie the VM to one single hardware.
==> Single Root I/O Virtualization solves this by allowing multiple VMs to connect with 1 NIC without affecting the performance.
