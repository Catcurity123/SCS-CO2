#### A. R53 Hosted Zones
(+) A `R53 Hosted Zone` is a DNS DB for a domain e.g. animals4life.org. `Globally resilient` (multiple DNS Servers).
(+) Created with domain registration via R53 - can be created separately

###### 1. R53 Public Hosted Zones
(+) DNS Database (zone file) hosted by R53 (`Public Name Servers`).
(+) Accessible from the `public internet` & `VPCs`.
(+) Hosted on `4` R53 Name Servers (`NS`) specific for the zone.
(+) Use `NS Records` to point at thes `NS` (connect to global DNS)
(+) Resource Records (RR) created within the hosted zone.
(+) Externally registered doains can point at R53 Public Zone.

###### 2. R53 Private Hosted Zones
(+) R53 Zone is inaccessible from the public internet. Zone cannot be queried outside of associated VPCs

###### 3. R53 Split View Hosted Zones.
(+) Inside VPCs associated with the private hosted zone all resouce records can be accessed.
(+) A common architecture is to make the private zone a superset, containing more sensitive records.

#### B. AWS R53 Routing
###### 0. R53 Health Checks
(+) Health check are separate from, but are used by records.
(+) Done by health checkers located `globally`.
(+) Health checkers check every 30s (every 10s costs extra
(+) If `18% +` global checkers report `healthy`, then the health check is `healthy`

###### 1. R53 Simple Routing
(+) All values are return in a random order
(+) Simple Routing supports `1 record per name (WWW)`
(+) Each recourd can have `multiple values`
=> Simple Routing does not support health checks - all values are returned for a record when queried
====> Use `Simple Routing` when you want to route requests towards `one service` such as a web server.

###### 2. R53 Failover Routing
(+) A common architecture is to use failover for a `out of band` failure/maintenance page for a service.
(+) If the target of the health check is `Unhealthy`, any queries return the `secondary record` of the same name.
(+) If the target of the health check is `Healthy`, the `Primary` record is used

###### 3. R53 Multi Value Routing
(+) Multi Value Routing supports multiple records with the same name
(+) Each record is independent and can have an associated health check
(+) Any records which fail health checks wont be returned when queried
(+) Up to 8 `healthy` records are returned. If more exist, 8 are randomly selected

###### 4. R53 Weighted Routing
(+) A `0` weight mean record is `never returned` unless all are `0` then all are considered.
(+) Each record is returned based on its `record weight` vs `total weight`.

###### 5. R53 Latency-Based Routing
(+) Optimising for `performance` and `user experience`.
