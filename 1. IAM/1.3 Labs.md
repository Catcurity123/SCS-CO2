#### A. Revoking IAM Role Temporary Credentials

###### Overview
(+) Roles can be `assumed` by many identities. Permissions are `granted` through temporary credentials, and it `can't be cancelled`.
==> What would happen if it is leaked, as it can not be cancelled?
(+) If we delete, it will impact ALL assumers.

(+) Malicious assumers got the credentials, we might think about `changing the trust policy`, but it will work only for credentials` yet to assumed`, this case the malicious assumers has already assumed the credentials.  
(+) If we change the permission policy, every entities assumed the role will be affected.
==> In this case, we will update the permission policy with a `new inline policy` that will `deny the access for any sessions older than NOW` (using `AWSRevokeOlderSessions`)
