#### A. IAM Policy Fundamental
IAM Policy Document contains:
(+) `Version` policy element is used within a policy and defines the version of the policy language, normally it is `2012-10-17` as this is the current version for IAM policy being employed, the old version is `2008-10-17`

(+)`Statement`: contains the following elements:
	- Statement ID (`Sid`): Optional field that identifies the Statement and what a Statement does
	- `Effect`: Specifies whether the statement is `Allow` or explicitly `Deny`
	- `Action`: The action (accessing a service) of the statement.
	- `Resource`: The resource for the statement.

There are two kinds of policies:
(+) `Inline Policy`: Policy that is applied individually to IAM entity, changing the policy means that it is changed for the entire IAM entity.
(+) `Managed Policy`:  A managed policy is a standalone entity that exists independently of IAM entities. It can be created, modified, and attached/detached from multiple IAM entities across AWS accounts.

#### B. IAM User
(+) `Principal`:  An `unidentified` entity trying to access an AWS account. A `Principal` must be authenticate an identity in `IAM` by making a request.
	(-) The authentication process can be by using `credentials` or `access key`.
	(-) Once the `Principal` is authenticated, `IAM` will authorize according policy for the `Principal` to work on.

(+) `Amazon Resource Name (ARN)`: is used to Uniquely identify resources within any AWS account as there could be similar names and characteristic for services on multiple account. This is normally used on `IAM Policy` for authorizing resource to an `entity`

![[Pasted image 20231228151918.png]]

(+) There can be `5000` IAM Users per account and one IAM User can only be a member of maximum `10` groups.
	- This has a `system design impacts` for Internet-scale applications or Large Orgs or org merges
	==> This can be mitigate by using `IAM Roles and Identity Federation`

#### C. IAM Groups
(+) `IAM Groups` are `containers` for `IAM Users`, this is just for better management, IAM Group has no credentials and can not be logged in nor could it be used to make any change.

(+) `IAM Groups` allows for administratively organized mangement.
![[Pasted image 20231229141821.png]]

(+) Users in multiple IAM Groups can have multiple IAM Policies as well as the inline policies for itself, to evaluate the final access right, AWS merges all the policies and evaluate them.

`NOTE`
(+) Groups are not a `true identity`, they can't be referenced as a `principal` in a policy.
	==> This means group are just there for management purposes, we create permission and assign permission to groups and for all users in the group to inherit. Group can not be used as a `principal` for referencing in policies.

#### D. IAM Roles
(+) `IAM Roles` and `IAM User` are AWS authenticated entity that can use or make changes to AWS services, however, there is a major difference between them.
	(-) `IAM User` is the entity for a `single principal` (meaning a user, a service, or a process) that wants to access AWS services
	(-) `IAM Role` is the entity for `multiple principal`  or `unknown number of principles` that wants to access AWS services. Roles are also used for entity which required a short period.

``` Example
IAM User: A network admin that has an IAM User of "NetworkAdmin".
IAM Role: A large number of normal users that want to access a web page hosted on AWS.

==> In the example above, we see that IAM User is an entity that represents what you are in real life, IAM Role, on the other hand, represents a level of access inside AWS account, it is something that can be used short term by other identities.
```

(+) `IAM User` has policies attached to its, `inline policies` or `managed policies` these policies are called `Permission Policy`. `IAM Roles`, on the other hand, has 2 kinds of policy attached to its, the `Permission Policy (just like IAM User)` and the `Trust Policy`.
(+) `Trust Policy` lists the principals that can assume the role, so if the person, service or process is in the trust policy, it can assume the role. Succeed in doing so will trigger a `Temporary Security Credentials` for the person, service, or process to access that role for a temporary period of time.
	(-) The `Temporary Security Credentials` is created and manged by `AWS Security Token Service (STS)` via `sts:AssumRole`
	==> An `IAM Role` is a real entity that has its own `Permission Policy`, so every principal that can assume the role via `Trust Policy` can perform the access right listed in the `Permission Policy`

#### E. When to use IAM Roles
`Example 1:`
(+) As stated above, `IAM Roles` are perfect for `an unknown number of principals` or `multiple principals` cases. An example for this is `AWS Lambda function`.
(+) `AWS Lambda function` is attached with a role called `Lambda Execution Role` that has its own `Permmission Policy`, as it is attached to the lamda function, meaning that the `lambda function` is in the role's `trust policy` to perform whatever listed in `permission policy`.
	==> So whenever the function is executed it will trigger `sts:AssumeRole` to get short-term credentials and access resources specified in the role's `Permission Policy`
![[Pasted image 20231229145735.png]]

`Example 2:`
(+) `IAM Roles` are perfect for short period tasks that does not need the long-term characteristic of an `IAM User`, this can be used for `Break-glass situation` when an entity has a limited role, but can also assume a more privileged role for emerging situation.
	(-) Wayne is in a group of helpdesk that only has a `Permission Policy` of read-only to the specified resources. However, he can also assume a role with a different `Permission Policy (maybe more privileged)` for emerging situation that can not be solved using his `IAM User's Permission Policy`.
![[Pasted image 20231229150423.png]]

`Example 3:`
(+) Another use case for `IAM Roles` is when we have an exisisting on-premise architecture with exisisting users and we want to connect the existing user to `AWS Resources`. `IAM User` for each exisisting user would not be feasible as there is a fix limit of 5000 `IAM User`. We can create an `IAM Role` that has a `Trust Policy` of the current user and assign an `Permission Policy` so that users in the `Trust Policy` can access the resources in AWS.
![[Pasted image 20231229151042.png]]


`Example 4:`
(+) Another use case is the use of existing `web identities` for an application. For example, if an application wants to allows its users to access resources on AWS, but does not want to create every `IAM User` for each existing users (as there is a limit and is not feasible), we can create a roles that has the `trust policy` of the current users in the application (whether they authenticated themselves using credentials or SSO via social network) and attach a `permission policy` for the role.

#### F. Service-linked roles
(+) IAM role linked to a **specific AWS service**, it is `predefined` by a service.
(+) It provides permissions that a service needs to interact with other AWS services on your behalf.
(+) Service might create/delete the role, or allow you to during the setup or within IAM.
==> You can't delete the role untill its no logner required
![[Pasted image 20240813104056.png]]

(+) We can use this for role separation, the security team can create a role for a service, then asssign a user with permission to list and pass role. Meaning the user can only use the permission to gain other pre-created permission by the security team.
