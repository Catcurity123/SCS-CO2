#### A. IAM Roles use cases
`Example 1:`
(+) As stated above, `IAM Roles` are perfect for `an unknown number of principals` or `multiple principals` cases. An example for this is `AWS Lambda function`.
(+) `AWS Lambda function` is attached with a role called `Lambda Execution Role` that has its own `Permmission Policy`, as it is attached to the lamda function, meaning that the `lambda function` is in the role's `trust policy` to perform whatever listed in `permission policy`.
	==> So whenever the function is executed it will trigger `sts:AssumeRole` to get short-term credentials and access resources specified in the role's `Permission Policy`

`Example 2:`
(+) `IAM Roles` are perfect for short period tasks that does not need the long-term characteristic of an `IAM User`, this can be used for `Break-glass situation` when an entity has a limited role, but can also assume a more privileged role for emerging situation.
	(-) Wayne is in a group of helpdesk that only has a `Permission Policy` of read-only to the specified resources. However, he can also assume a role with a different `Permission Policy (maybe more privileged)` for emerging situation that can not be solved using his `IAM User's Permission Policy`.

`Example 3:`
(+) Another use case for `IAM Roles` is when we have an exisisting on-premise architecture with exisisting users and we want to connect the existing user to `AWS Resources`. `IAM User` for each exisisting user would not be feasible as there is a fix limit of 5000 `IAM User`. We can create an `IAM Role` that has a `Trust Policy` of the current user and assign an `Permission Policy` so that users in the `Trust Policy` can access the resources in AWS.\

`Example 4:`
(+) Another use case is the use of existing `web identities` for an application. For example, if an application wants to allows its users to access resources on AWS, but does not want to create every `IAM User` for each existing users (as there is a limit and is not feasible), we can create a roles that has the `trust policy` of the current users in the application (whether they authenticated themselves using credentials or SSO via social network) and attach a `permission policy` for the role.
