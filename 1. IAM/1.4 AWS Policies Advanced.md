#### A. IAM Policies Advanced
(+) Summary of all IAM Policies and how to use them.
(+) On a high level, there are only 2 types of policy:`Permission Policy` which grants permission and `Limiting Policy` which limits permission. These 2 main types of policies is then divided into 5 categories

##### A1. Permission Policies (IAM Policy and Resource Policy)
(+) The only policies that can grant permissions to an identity are `IAM Policy` (or identity-based policy) and `Resource Policy`.
(+) If no `ALLOW` statements appear in either of those 2 policies, your access request would be `implicitly denied`.

###### 1. IAM Policy or Identity-based policy
(+) IAM policies are` permission statements` applied to `AWS identities – user, role or group`, which specify what actions can be performed by that identity on an AWS resource/service.

There are two kinds of policies:
(+) `Inline Policy`: Policy that is applied individually to IAM entity, changing the policy means that it is changed for the entire IAM entity.
(+) `Managed Policy`:  A managed policy is a standalone entity that exists independently of IAM entities. It can be created, modified, and attached/detached from multiple IAM entities across AWS accounts.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

###### 2. Resource Policy
(+) There is another way to grant such permissions by assigning them directly to the resources itself, which are called AWS resource policies. 
(+) So, an` IAM policy` is attached to an `identity` like user, group or role, and an AWS `resource policy` is attached to a `resource` like S3, KMS, Lambda, etc.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/ExampleUser"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

###### 3. Policy Evaluation for IAM Policy and Resource Policiy
(+) `For Intra-Account Access`: the total permission applicable to an AWS principal is the **addition** of the permissions provided in the IAM policy and Resource policy. The `implicit deny` is by default, the `explicit deny` will override `explicit allow`.

==> `Example`: consider a user – `Indiana` with an` IAM policy` attached to it which gives the permission – “lambda:InvokeFunction” on a Lambda function. Also, the same Lambda function has a resource policy which allows user Indiana to do – “lambda:TagResource”. Then the total permission for user Indiana on that Lambda function would be – “lambda:InvokeFunction, lambda:TagResource.

`NOTE`: There will be an exception for KMS, for example, when we encrypt an object in S3 with a KMS key, in that case, even if the identity has an allow in the IAM Policy and an allow in the S3 Resouce Policy for the identity. The identity would not be able to interact with the object, the user will need an additional allow (for decryption using KMS) in KMS's Resource Policy. [Check this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSfjpaxULro).

(+) `For Cross-Account Access`: Cross-Account access means that a principal in one AWS account sends a request to access the resources of another AWS account. In this case, AWS allows the cross-account request only when explicit allows are made in **_both_** the `IAM policy` (attached to the principal requesting access) and `Resource Policy`.

==> `Example`: David wants to read objects from a S3 bucket in a different AWS account. First, the admin of the account which has the S3 bucket would need to add permissions to David’s IAM user to be able to read objects from the S3 bucket via S3 bucket policy. Then David needs to give his own IAM user permissions to be able to read objects from that particular S3 bucket via IAM policy attached to the user.
![[../Picture/Pasted image 20240814162618.png]]

==> `Example 2`: The admin for the S3 bucket AWS account could have also created an IAM role with permissions to read objects from the S3 bucket and a trust policy allowing it to be assumed by David’s IAM user from a different account. Then, the IAM policy for David’s IAM user would need to have permissions to assume the above IAM role. Note the subtle difference in this pattern from the previous one, the resource being accessed cross-account is the IAM role (not S3).

##### A2. Limiting Policies (Permission Boundary, Service Control Policies (SCPs), and Session Policy)
(+) The remaining three policies – `Service Control Policy (SCP)`, `Permissions Boundary` and `Session Policy` are only limiting the maximum permissions that are allowed by the `Permission Policies` (IAM policy and Resource policy).
(+) This means that even if a permission is allowed by the Permission Policies, if that permission is “not” explicitly allowed in the limiting policies (IMPLICIT DENY) or if explicitly denied, the access would be denied.

###### 1. Permission Boundary
(+) `Permissions Boundary` is another type of AWS policy but instead of granting or revoking permissions, it is used to` limit the total permissions` that can be applied to a particular IAM principal – IAM users, groups or roles.

==> `Example`: Shizuka has been granted S3 full admin permissions using the IAM managed policy of AmazonS3FullAccess. Then a Permissions Boundary is assigned to Shizuka’s IAM user with an IAM managed policy of AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess, then the access that Shizuka has is AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess as PB limits the total permission that a principal can have.

`To understand the use of PB, we use the delegation problem`
(+) Consider a scenario – `Katrina`, the Administrator for an AWS account, wants to `create an agile and flexible AWS permissions management model`. In this model, Katrina wants their company’s software developers to be able to create their own AWS IAM permissions as needed for application development needs. But Katrina understands that creating such a delegated permissions model might cause a security compromise.

==> If Katrina grants Developers the iam:CreateRole permission, this will enable Developers to create their own permission grants for their custom applications but Developers might also `inadvertently create roles with permissions for sensitive activities` like creation of long lived credentials with admin access, deletion of customer data, deletion of audit logs, etc. Or they can create a role with full admin and assume it.

![[../Picture/Pasted image 20240814165252.png]]

`Our solution is Permission Boundary`
(+) If a permission boundary is attached to an identity (user or role), it limits the maximum permissions that the identity can have, even if that permission is allowed by the IAM policy. So Katrina creates a Permissions Boundary with the following:
- Allow all permissions on AWS (this is the base rule)
- Deny permissions for sensitive activities like creation of long lived credentials with admin access, deletion of customer data, deletion of audit logs, etc.
- Deny creation of any Principal like IAM users, groups or roles without this permissions boundary
- Deny updates to this permissions boundary except from Katrina’s user or another IAM Admin user/role

(+) Then Katrina attaches this to the Developers role along with the iam:createRole IAM policy, and bingo, with this design Katrina solved the problem we started with. Now developers have the flexibility to create their own custom roles with permissions that they want and Katrina still gets the security assurance that Developers will not inadvertently create roles with permissions for sensitive activities.

==> Permission Boundary is useful for limiting subsequent Permission Policy when creating new role, or user. [Check this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97sJl5U8SO8).

###### 2. Service Control Policies (SCPs)
(+) `AWS Service Control Policy (SCP)` is a `limiting` AWS `policy`, which limits the maximum permission for a particular AWS Account or multiple AWS accounts onboarded to AWS Organization.

(+) Thus it can be used to create `Security and Compliance Guardrails/preventative controls` across multiple AWS accounts in an organization.

(+) Unlike the other three policies which are applicable to identities (IAM policy, Permissions Boundary) and resources (Resource policy) within only a single AWS account, SCPs can be applied to multiple AWS accounts which are organized and managed using `AWS Organization`.

==> `Example`: Company X has 1000 AWS accounts (size is pretty common for most medium-large tier software organizations today). Oleg, the Security Engineer, wants to create a preventative security policy or security guardrail to protect the company’s AWS accounts from using insecure third-party Compute images. So Oleg creates the below AWS policy to enforce the use of only Security-approved images (from account – _secure-images-aws-account_) by requiring that all EC2 instances launched in the account must use AMIs owned by that same account.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "GuardrailAgainstThirdPartyImages",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:RunInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*::image/ami-*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "ec2:Owner": [
            "secure-images-aws-account"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
==> If Oleg did not have the option of using SCP, the answer to this question would require some pretty heavy automation. Why? Because without SCP, the best option for Oleg would be to use Permissions Boundary for this policy, but it is only applicable to an identity within a single account. So the Permissions Boundary would need to be applied to **_each_** identity in **_each of the 1000 AWS accounts_**.

###### 3. Session Policy
(+) `AWS Session policy` is a limiting AWS policy, which limits the maximum permission for a particular AWS session (assumed role session or user federated session)
(+) it is used to` limit the total permissions`. But the way it differs from them is that instead of applying these `maximum permissions to an identity` like user or role (in the case of Permissions Boundary) or to an account or OU (in the case of SCP), Session policy applies the `maximum permissions to an assumed session`.
(+) To put it simply, whenever you are `assuming a role` or` federating a user` (creating temporary credentials for a user), you are creating a `temporary session from those identities` and you will be given an opportunity to supply Session policies to restrict permissions in those specific time-bound sessions.

==> `Example`: We are taking the example of a mature software company that uses Federated identities to login to AWS, meaning the users are not created in AWS, but are leveraged from the company’s Identity portal. Employees first login using their corporate credentials to the SSO portal. Once the employee’s login is verified, they select the AWS account and the IAM role which they want to access. And if they have been granted permissions to access that AWS account, SSO portal uses its native AWS identity to assume the requested role on user’s behalf, and sends 2 things back to the user – url for login to the AWS console and the credentials to access AWS CLI (aws access key, secret access key and session token).

![[../Picture/Pasted image 20240814171357.png]]

==> But as we saw in the design of federated AWS SSO using Corporate Identity, the SSO portal was assuming the same AWS role for getting CLI credentials as well as the console url. So we cannot apply the above IAM Policy on the AWS role since then it would be applicable to both the CLI access as well as console access. And that’s the problem that Session policies aim to solve as they are used for putting access restrictions on individual sessions created from the same role.

`NOTE`:If a Resource policy allows a permission from the same AWS Principal (IAM user, Role Session, Federated User) which is making the request, then even if that permission is “not” explicitly allowed in Permissions Boundary or Session Policy, it will still be allowed. Please note that the allowed principal has to be the same User or “session” principal which is making the request.
