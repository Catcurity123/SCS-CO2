#### A. Revoking IAM Role Temporary Credentials
###### Overview
(+) Roles can be `assumed` by many identities. Permissions are `granted` through temporary credentials, and it `can't be cancelled`.
==> What would happen if it is leaked, as it can not be cancelled?
(+) If we delete, it will impact ALL assumers.

(+) Malicious assumers got the credentials, we might think about `changing the trust policy`, but it will work only for credentials` yet to assumed`, this case the malicious assumers has already assumed the credentials.  
(+) If we change the permission policy, every entities assumed the role will be affected.
==> In this case, we will update the permission policy with a `new inline policy` that will `deny the access for any sessions older than NOW` (using `AWSRevokeOlderSessions`)

###### Labs Action
(1) Create 2 instances
(2) Take the credentials from the EC2 Instances
(3) Use it on different machine
(4) Revoke using IAM revokeoldersession

#### B. Use Resource Policy to restrict access to just one user.

#### C. Use AssumRole for user to assume a role for S3 full access

#### D. Use Permission Boundary to restrict user's permissions

#### E. Attach a Session Policy when assuming a role.
