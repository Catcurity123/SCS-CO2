#### A. S3 Bucket Policies
(+) Bucket Policy works on an  `entire bucket` level.
(+) S3 Bucket policies is a form of `resource policy`, just like `identity policy`. The main difference is that `resource policy` is assigned to a `resource`, while `identity policy` is assigned to an `identity`.
(+) This provide a `resource perspective permission`, meaning we are controlling `who can access this resource`, while with `identity policy` we are controlling what can that identity access.
(+) Bucket policy can `Allow/Deny` `anonymous` principals, which can't be done using `identity policy`.

###### Example
(+) Another main difference between `Resource policy` and `Identity policy`  is the exisistence of `Principal` field in the policy. For `Identity Policy` it is understood that the `Principal` is the creating account itself, however,  for `Resource policy` we must explicitly provide the `Principal` who can access the resource.

(+) There can only be 1 bucket policy applied to the bucket, but the policy can have multiple statements.

#### B. Access Control Lists (ACLs)
(+) ACLs work on `object-level`.
(+) ACLs on objects and bucket, it is a subresource and is legacy.
(+) The reason is because it is inflexible and simple permission.

#### C. Block Public Access
(+) This setting is only applied to `public and anonymous principals`. It provide an extra, outter layer of protection for S3 bucket. `Bucket policy`, however, is the inner protection of S3 bucket


![[Pasted image 20240103150918.png | 600]]

(+) `Option 1`: Enable all the other options
(+) `Option 2`: Block public access to newly added buckets or objects and prevent the creation of new ACLs for existing buckets and objects. However, this setting does not change existing permissions that allows public access to S3 using ACLs.
(+) `Option 3`: Block public access to all buckets and objects no matter it is newly created or existing.
(+) `Option 4`: Block public access to newly added buckets or objects. However, this setting does not change existing permissions that allows public access to S3 through policies.
(+) `Option 5`: Block public access and cross-account access to buckets and objects no matter it is newly created or existing.

### Summary 
(+) `Identity Policy` is a good method when we need to control different resources through one centralized platform on one account.
(+) `Bucket Policy or Resource Policy` is a good method when we need to control access right to one product or access can be through anonymous and cross-account principals.
(+) `Buckets are private by default`: When you create an S3 bucket, it is private by default(including all objects within it). You have to allow public access on both the bucket and its object in order to make the bucket public
(+) `Object ACLs`: You can make `indibidual objects` public using object ACLs.
(+) `Bucket policies`: YOu can make `entire buckets` public using bucket policies
(+) `HTTP status code`: when you upload an object to S3 and its successful, you will receive an HTTP 200 code.

#### D. Object versioning
(+) Object versioning is a setting at `bucket level`, it is `disabled` by default, and once it is `enabled` it can not be set to `disabled` again. It can however be `suspended` and `enabled` again if required.

![[Pasted image 20240103191552.png | 600]]

(+) Versioning lets we store `multiple versions` of objects within a bucket. Operations which would modify the objects `generate a new version`.
	(-) Objects in S3 has an `ID` field, when `object version` is `disabled` this field is `null`. When it is enabled, each objects in the bucket will have an `id`. Operation on this object will create a new version of the object with a different ID while retaining the old object.

![[Pasted image 20240103192003.png | 600]]

(+) Deletion will also affect object versioning, when we delete an object without specifying the version, it will create a `delete marker` which will `HIDE` all the object regarding of its version (not delete just hide). We can delete the `delete marker` to restore the object. But if we delete an object while specifying the version, the next most recent object will be come the current object.

![[Pasted image 20240103192438.png]]

(+) If `Object Versioning` is enable, space is consumed by `ALL` versions, and we will be billed for `ALL` versions. Only way to zero out the cost is to delete the bucket as this setting `CAN NOT BE DISABLED` only suspended, and when suspended all the version is still there.

###### D1. MFA Delete
(+) This is enabled in `versioning configuration`, meaning that MFA is required to change `versioning state`. and MFA is required to `delete versions`.
(+) Serial number (MFA) + Code passed with API CALLs is required.

#### E. S3 Storage Classes
###### E1. S3 Standard
![[Pasted image 20240104135116.png | 600]]
(+) Objects are replicated accross `at least 3 AZs` in the AWS region
(+) Billed a `GB/m fee` for `data stored`. A `$ per GB` for transfer `OUT` (In is free) and a price `per 1,000 requests`.
(+) Suitable for `Frequently Accessed` data which is `important and non replaceable`.

###### E2. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
![[Pasted image 20240104135716.png | 600]]
(+) Same as Standard but it has a `per GB data retrieval fee` meaning frequent data access will increase the cost. It also has a `minimum duration charge of 30 days` and a `minimum capacity charge` of 128KB. Meaning that no matter how short and small your data is and is stored, it will be charged minimum `30 days` and `128KB`, and the bill charged will increase the longer and larger your data is and is stored.
(+) S3 Standard-IA should be used for `long-lived data`, which is `important` but where access is `infrequent`. Dont use it for small data which is stored for a short period and can be easily replaced.

###### E3. S3 One zone-IA
![[Pasted image 20240104140340.png | 600]]
(+) The same as S3 Standard-IA but does not have replication on multiple AZs
(+) Suitable for `long-lived data` which is `non-critical` and `replaceable` and where access is `infrequent`.

###### E4. S3 Glacier
![[Pasted image 20240104141012.png | 600]]
(+) In S3 Glacier, Objects is in `chilled state` meaning that it can not be accessed right away, there is a `retrieval process` that need to be done in order to move that objects to Standard-IA temporarily for viewing. The objects can not be made public either.
(+) There is a `40KB min size` and `90 day min duration` bill for objects in this class. 
(+) S3 Glacier is suitable for `archival data` where `frequent or realtime` access `is not needed`. As it is `miniute-hours first byte latency` different from S3 standard which is `milisecond first byte latency`. But it is one of the cheapest form of storage.
(+) Provides `long-term data archiving` with `instant retrieval` time for your data

###### Glacier Flexible Retrieval
(+) Ideal for storage class for archive data that does not require immediate access but needs the flexibility to retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as back up or disaster recovery use cases. Can be minute or up to 12 hourse

###### E5. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
(+) This class is approximately one-fourth the price of S3 Glacier but with more restriction.
![[Pasted image 20240104141619.png | 600]]
(+) If data in S3 Glacier is in `chilled state` then data in S3 Glacier Deep Archive is in `frozen state` which requires much longer time for retrieval process.
(+) This class is suitable for `archival data` that rarely if ever needs to be accessed - hours of days for retrieval. This is used for legal or regulation data storage of data.

###### E6. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
