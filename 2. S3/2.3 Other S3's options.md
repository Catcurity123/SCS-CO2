(+) `aws s3 presign s3://url --expires-in 180 (in seconds)`

`NOTE`:
(+) We can create a URL for an object we dont have access to, as the presignedURL will not check the `permission of the receiving principal`, if we dont have access to it, even if we create an URL, we still can not view or perform any operation on it.
(+) When using the URL, the permissions match the `identity which generated it`. Which means even if you have access to the media, if the one who generated the presignedURL does not have access to the media, you still can not use it.
(+) `Do not generate presignedURL with an assumerole` as assumerole will expire for a period of time, which means the presignedURL will also expire. A `long-term identity` is the prefered way of creating presignedURL.

#### B. S3 Select and Glacier Select
(+) S3 can archive a file up to 5TB, when we want to retrieve such file, it will take times and costs for doing so, we can filtered the data after downloading the file, however, this is just for discarding data that we dont need, the whole time and cost is still billed.
(+) The solution for this is using `S3 Select and Glacier Select` which is a `SQL-like` statement service that allow us to filter the needed information and only billed for the needed information.
